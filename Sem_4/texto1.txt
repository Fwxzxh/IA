Herâ€™s

I thought you left alone last night
Put to bed, my greatest fear
I know I don't reserve the right
But by simply hoping he's not here

Please, don't say that you've seen him
She's probably got her life laid out
Just let me dream a little more

My heart takes up all my strength
No more can I think of them
No more can I hold her in my thoughts
Don't say that she needs him
That she needs him

That she needs him

He probably lives alone, you know
How am I ever to compare?
Oh why can't she be alone for good
So I can dream and never dare?

Please, don't say that you've seen him
She's probably got her life laid out
Just let me dream a little more

My heart takes up all my strength
No more can I think of them
No more can I hold her in my thoughts
Don't say that she needs him
That she needs him

Nobody knows
I wish she could
Holding me close
As if she would

Nobody knows
I wish she could
Holding me close
Holding me close

My heart takes up all my strength
No more can I think of them
No more can I hold her in my thoughts
Don't say that she needs him
That he needs her

I want her to know
He don't have it all
I want her to know
He don't have it all

I want her to know
He don't have it all
I want her to know
He don't have it all

I want her to know
He don't have it all
I want her to know
He don't have it all

I want her to know
He don't have it all
I want her to know
He don't have it all
